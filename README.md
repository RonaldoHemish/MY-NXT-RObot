# NXT Line Detection Robot

This project demonstrates a line detection and stopping mechanism using a LEGO NXT robot programmed with the NXT block-based coding language. The robot detects a line on the floor and stops once it crosses it.

## Project Overview

- **Robot Platform**: LEGO NXT
- **Programming Language**: NXT block-based programming
- **Functionality**: The robot detects a black line on the floor and automatically stops when it crosses the line.

## Team Members
- [Your Name]
- Harshil

## How It Works

1. The robot is equipped with a light sensor to detect the contrast between the floor and the line.
2. The program continuously monitors the sensor's readings.
3. Once the robot detects the line, it sends a stop command to halt its motion.

## Installation

To run this program on your LEGO NXT robot:

1. Open the NXT programming software.
2. Import the project file (`.rbt` or similar).
3. Upload it to your NXT robot.
4. Position the robot near a line and start the program.
5. Watch as the robot detects the line and stops.

## Future Improvements

- Add more sensors for enhanced accuracy.
- Improve the stopping precision by fine-tuning sensor readings.
